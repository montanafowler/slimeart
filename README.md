# SlimeArt

SlimeArt is a generative art tool for artists to create dynamic pieces out of an agent-based algorithm modeled after the emergent behavior of slime mold.

To download an executable of the application, select from the resolution options in the executables folder.  Unfortunately, SlimeArt works exclusively on Windows machines due to its dependency on compute shaders.
